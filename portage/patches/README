# Adding user patches

First choose the location for the patches. Granularity can be determined by package name and the version(s) for which the patch is intended. Use the following locations and optionally append :${SLOT} to any of them:

``` text
/etc/portage/patches/${CATEGORY}/${P}
/etc/portage/patches/${CATEGORY}/${PN}
/etc/portage/patches/${CATEGORY}/${P}-${PR}
```

Examples:

``` text
/etc/portage/patches/dev-lang/python
/etc/portage/patches/dev-lang/python:3.4
/etc/portage/patches/dev-lang/python-3.4.2
/etc/portage/patches/dev-lang/python-3.3.5-r0
/etc/portage/patches/dev-lang/python-3.3.5-r1
```
